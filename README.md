Creating a personal portfolio to showcase my programming and other creative endeavours.
I am learning HTML, css and JS as I go - for now I have been heavily modifying a template from https://html5up.net/
Therefore the majority of the css and JS scripts are not my own.

In the future I intend to rip this down and re-prepare entirely from scratch, but there's only so many hours in a day. 
And creating a portfolio is more important at the moment.

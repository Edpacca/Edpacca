Jeremyah Snagglebark, a forgetful 342 year old forest Gnome wizard, is a character I had the pleasure of creating and playing in a campaign back in Edinburgh that lasted around 2 years. I wanted to write about him because his story is very special to me, and in ,fact there was a lot I wasn't aware of until he left the party - whilst I left in real life to move to Canada.

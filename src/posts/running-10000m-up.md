For 2023 I set myself the lofty (but achievable) target of running 10,000m of elevation gain. I have run for fun and easy exercise for a few years now, and for some reason I really enjoy running up hills. (I do like Kate Bush).

Edinburgh lends itself very well to this, and with Arthur's seat on my doorstep I thought why not. I initially set myself a 5k goal, but was talked up to 10k by a friend. He was right! I underestimated myself and managed to rack up the first 1000m quite quickly. 

I found Strava Challenges very useful as a driver for keeping me out on the trails. I managed to get 2000m elevation in March although it was definitely a lot more running than I'm used to! It's now September and despite a reasonable break in July and August I'm still just ahead of schedule - I'm doing my second 2000m in one Month challenge and hope to beat my initial 10,000m goal by as much as possible.

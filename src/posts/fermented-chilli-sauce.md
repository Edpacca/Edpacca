I started making chili sauce back when my grandmother's friend... just kidding. Here's a recipe.



## Ingredients
- <FaIcon icon="pepper-hot"/> 1 bag of dried chilis
- <FaIcon icon="carrot"/> 1 carrot
- 1 red onion
- 1 whole garlic bulb
- some salt ?
- <FaIcon icon="droplet"/> water
- white wine and/or apple cider vinegar

# Basic Idea
We want to get our vegetable matter to ferment, which means some nice bacteria start to break them down, softening and giving a nice flavour. To do this we just suspend them in salt water for a few weeks - A little salt will kill off harmful bacteria, too much salt will kill off our good bacteria. We're basically trying to let things rot in a controlled way. Sounds gross? Trust me it's bloody great. Blue cheese and bread are some of the best things and they come from similar processes.

### The Chilis 
Dried chilis are easy and super cheap - if you've got a local asian supermarket then these will have huge backs for good value - yeah get those really gnarly looking round ones, not the long thin ones. If you can't find these then just get a bunch of fresh chilis! You can get into different types of chilis and all their different flavours in your own time, but the principle is the same.

### The Water
drinking is fine if you like somewhere with nice water. If you don't (looking at you London), get bottled spring water.

### The Veg
Use what you want!
